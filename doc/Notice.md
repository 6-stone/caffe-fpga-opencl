# Notice

**Right now I am working on my master thesis project, and not able to pay too much attention for this project.**
If you have questions, **don't email me**, please send an issue. Don't bother if you want me to

- Fix your FPGA configuration problem
- Port/optimize any caffe model for you
- Implement any new features you solely want

But I appreciate any help/pull request/mistake corrections.
